## Tips and Tricks

### üí° **Smart Date Parsing**
- Use any of the supported date formats for maximum flexibility
- Add times in 24-hour format (1400 = 2:00 PM)
- Dates without times default to midnight (00:00)

### üîç **Efficient Searching**
- Search works with partial matches: "book" finds "textbook"
- Case doesn't matter: "BOOK" and "book" work the same
- Search across all task types and their descriptions

### üìÖ **Task Management**
- Task numbers can change after deletions - always check with `list` first
- Completed tasks stay in your list until manually deleted
- All changes are automatically saved

### ‚ö° **Keyboard Shortcuts**
- Commands are case-insensitive: `TODO` and `todo` work the same
- Extra spaces are handled gracefully: `  todo   read book  ` works fine
